### Shapes and shaping
    
* circle can become other geometries; any shape can be made and replace the circle [see css eg.](https://css-tricks.com/the-shapes-of-css/)

* critique on the circle: "How to think through and withthe constraints of non-circular togetherness?" — 1^
    * distance from a shared center; constant radius from the middle.

* questions on geometric formations:
    * edges, limits, boundaries;
    * scales;
    
---
    
* relating to circle/  new metaphors conecting the sound and visuals could focus on:
    * distances and proximities;
    * other movements (how the sound travels; we can play with measurements system in sound and visual composition — how the absraction of such conventions is felt/ phisically experienced);
    
--- 
_on sequence / dramaturgy:_

* focus on interactions instead of individual coding of sound and visuals;
* sequence *1* same as shared vocuabulary; *2* "dancers" disrupt the sequence.
* main structure: do we keep circle + half?
* improvisation qualities: 
    * search path; w/ content; 
    * how else in coding?

_more notes on revisising the syntax:_

* colouring array of the circle (used to be function edge_limits) can be made as an option;
    
* rethink "circulation_of_affects()" — > automatic scroll — > maybe replace for circular () — > now used for:
    * _scraping web content:_
        * we can flood the screen with news items /real time information and send back and forth the texts manipulated by each of us;
               
    * revise when to start automating / calling "dancer1 = new Dancer (dancer,vocab)"
    
    * remaining function either to exclude or come back to: 
        * cirque () orbit ()
        * periphery () radial_grammar() tangent () drop() — > display hidden id="text01";
        * perimeter () circumscribed () dissolving () — > background styling as permeable_language () 
        * expanding_the_void () — > letter spacing
    

* vocabulary = 
    * "welcome": welcome,        
    * "remove": remove,    
    * "private_circle": private_circle,  — > displays circle + background color;        
    * "public_sphere": public_sphere,    — > displays circle + background transparent;       
    * "spheres": spheres,    — >  now "public_or_private"  — > hides and displays circle      
    * "breathe_out": breathe_out,  — > scale 4x; — > the number parameter can be changed;          
    * "breathe_in":breathe_in,   — > scale 1x; — > the number parameter can be changed;           
    * "breathing":breathing,     — > replaced by continue_breathing () and stop_breathing ()              
    * "edge_limits": edge_limits, — > current function colouring array of the circle — > can be made as an option elsewhere — > new idea, eg.: "circle01" and "circle02" two or more circles intersecting.         
    * "no_edge":no_edge,          — > remove?           
    * "whole": whole,             — > rethink drop-shadow            
    * "vicious_circle": vicious_circle,         
    * "interrupt": interrupt,        
    * "centering":centering,     — > skew affect; rethink the name?  = off_balance;           
    * "permeable_language": permeable_language, — > sets a pattern to the backgound — maybe we can start working more in "layers" of background and foreground and add an opacity function to the iframe;           
    * //"chance_dance": chance_dance, — > choose randomly a function;        
    * //"from_orbit_to_orbit": from_orbit_to_orbit, — > could we build the array during the performance — as a trace / history of the pages accessed     
    * "gesto_ciclico": gesto_ciclico, — > opens pop-up windows;        
    * "another_vicious_circle": another_vicious_circle, — > closes pop-up windows;     
    * "interrupt_another_vicious_circle": interrupt_another_vicious_circle,          
    * "offstage": offstage

_notes on workshop:_

* the functions can be use for embodiment exercises;
* id="text01" +++ on the HTML file can be used as provocations for workshops but perhaps to much for the performance;

1. "Circles are omnipresent in practices and imaginaries of collectivity. However, their usefulness for thinking and moving with the kind of aspirational ambivalence that the Study Circle was committed to, is limited. Their flatness provides little in the way of vocabulary for more complex relational notions that attempt to include space, matter and time, let alone interspecies mingling and other uneasy alliances. The obligation to always stay at the same distance from the center promises a situation of equality but does so by conflating it with similarity. Circles divide spaces into an interior and an exterior, a binary separation that is never easy to overcome. We urgently need other axis to move along."
