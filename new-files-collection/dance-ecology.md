### some thoughts on the different coding files;

## HTML + CSS (elements) + JS (dancers)

# Scene Components: 
	
	•	__stage__ (the <body> is the primary stage; other <divs> funtion as distributed stages that can be overlaid or seen as separate;
	
		• __props__ can be added to each stage (like as in scenography: shapes; text; iframes; sounds...):
	
	•	__dancers__ (algorithmic characters that combine actions that include props in different stages)

		• dancers build up choreographies — set a choreographic relational filed;
		
	•	__performance score__  vocabulary that defines the interactions through naming the fields;
