## HTML(stage) + CSS (props) + JS (dancers)

# Scene Components: 
	
* __stage__ (the <body> is the primary stage; other <divs> funtion as distributed stages that can be overlaid or seen as separate;
	
*  __props__ can be added to each stage (like as in scenography: shapes; text; iframes; sounds...):
	
* __dancers__ (algorithmic characters that combine actions that include props in different stages)

	* dancers build up choreographies â€” set a choreographic relational filed;
	* action operators (add + / remove - / modify ~) + vocabulary (parameters) + output device / target system;
		
* __performance score__  composed by the choreographic vocabulary defined by the dancer which present the interactions through naming the fields;
